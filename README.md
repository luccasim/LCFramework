## Overview

This project is a technical test request from .
This is a personal project developer on my free time

## Delivery

## Feature

## Architecture

In our project we will use Protocol-Oriented Programming that simplifies architecting iOS apps, helps us avoid a tight coupling of classes with one another, allows as to use all the power of structs and enums by conforming them to protocols and makes it easier to write unit tests.

### UI

It's a simple list of items with a filter option. We use SwiftUI here, so view are declarative

### MVVM

View Model is a very powerfull design pattern and greatly adapt for swiftUI.
Our ViewModel are reactive and publish their change on views.

- Foundation
- SwiftUI
- UIKit
- Simulator on iphone 8

### Constraints
